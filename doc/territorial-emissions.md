###  Fossil fuels and cement production emissions by country (territorial, GCB)

All values in million tonnes of carbon per year. For values in million tonnes of CO2 per year, multiply the values below by 3.664

1MtC = 1 million tonne of carbon = 3.664 million tonnes of CO2

#### Methods

: By default, the 1959-2014 estimates for fossil fuels and cement are from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (CDIAC)

Where available (42 countries) the national estimates reported by countries to the UNFCCC during 1990-2016 are overwritten (data in green).

2017 (and for some countries 2015-2017) estimates are preliminary and are based on energy statistics published by BP (data in red). https://www.bp.com/content/dam/bp/en/corporate/pdf/energy-economics/statistical-review/bp-15stats-review-2018-full-report.pdf

Cement emissions are updated from Andrews (2018) https://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/10/195/2018/

(1) National estimates include emissions from fossil fuel combustion and oxidation and cement production and excludes emissions from bunker fuels. World totals include emissions from bunker fuels.

(2) Bunker fuels: Emissions from fuels used for international aviation and maritime transport

(3) The disaggregations of regions (e.g. the former Soviet Union prior to 1992) are based on the shares of emissions in the first year after the countries are disaggregated (e.g., 1992 for the Former Soviet).

(4) The statistical difference presented on column HX is the difference between the world emissions and the sum of the emissions for each countries and for the bunker fuels.
