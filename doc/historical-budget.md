### Historical CO2 budget

All values in billion tonnes of carbon per year (GtC/yr), for the globe. For values in billion tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) per year, multiply the numbers below by 3.664.

1 billion tonnes C = 1 petagram of carbon (10^15 gC) = 1 gigatonne C = 3.664 billion tonnes of CO2

#### Please note:

The methods used to estimate the historical fluxes presented below differ from the carbon budget presented from 1959 onwards. For example, the atmospheric growth and ocean sink do not account for year-to-year variability.

The ocean CO2 sink is the average of the two diagnostic ocean models:

E., Gerber, M., Doney, S. C., Graven, H. D., Gruber, N., McKinley, G. A., Murata, A., Rios, A. F., and Sabine, C. L.: Global ocean storage of anthropogenic carbon, Biogeosciences, 10, 2169-2191, 2013.

The land sink is the average of several dynamic global vegetation models that reproduce the observed mean total land sink of the 1990s.

The budget imbalance is the sum of emissions (fossil fuel and industry + land-use change) minus (atmospheric growth + ocean sink + land sink); it is a measure of our imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle.
